# Dr.plant

## Overview
Many people grow plants at home or on farms but often struggle to know if their plants are healthy or need special care. Sometimes, problems like too little water, too much sunlight, or poor soil conditions can harm plants without us noticing. This project, Dr.Plant, was created to help solve that problem by using sensor data and machine learning to predict plant health and give helpful care tips. With this tool, users can understand their plantâ€™s condition easily and take better care of them.
